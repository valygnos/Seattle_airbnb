## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda
distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle airbnb dataset to better understand:

1. How does location affect the price of a booking?
2. How the type of property contributes to the price?
3. How the benefits the place is offering can change the price?


## File Descriptions

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@valygnos/what-things-contribute-most-to-an-airbnb-price-7db48d021fe8).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive
information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
